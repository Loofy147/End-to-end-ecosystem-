# Full Project Summary: A Knowledge-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the development of a knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning agent. The project's primary goal was to create an AI that could not only learn from its own experiences but also leverage external knowledge from text and images to solve a mathematical puzzle more effectively.

## 2. Core Components

The agent's architecture is built upon several key Python classes:

### 2.1. `GoalDecompositionAgent`

This is the central agent responsible for decision-making. It employs a hierarchical strategy, breaking down large problems into smaller sub-goals.

### 2.2. `HierarchicalQNetwork`

A PyTorch neural network that powers the agent's decision-making process. It features a shared base layer and two distinct heads: one for high-level strategy (meta-actions) and one for low-level actions.

### 2.3. `KnowledgeBase`

The `KnowledgeBase` is a crucial component that allows the agent to store and retrieve external knowledge. It uses a pre-trained sentence-similarity model to find the most relevant information for a given situation.

## 3. Knowledge Integration

The project successfully demonstrated the integration of external knowledge from two sources:

-   **Text-Based Knowledge**: The agent can be provided with textual advice, which it uses to inform its strategy. This is achieved through the `KnowledgeBase` and a sentence-similarity model.
-   **Image-Based Knowledge**: The agent can also learn from visual information by using an image-to-text model to convert images into textual descriptions, which are then added to the `KnowledgeBase`.

## 4. Training and Evaluation

The agent was trained in a `KnowledgeEnhancedEnv`, a custom environment designed to provide context-specific knowledge during training. This approach proved to be highly effective, leading to a more robust and adaptable agent. The evaluation on a series of new and challenging puzzles showed that the knowledge-enhanced agent was able to solve them more efficiently than its predecessors.

## 5. Conclusion

This project has successfully demonstrated the power of combining reinforcement learning with external knowledge. The resulting agent is more intelligent, adaptable, and efficient than a standard reinforcement learning agent. The hierarchical architecture, combined with the ability to learn from text and images, represents a significant step forward in the development of more capable and versatile AI systems.
