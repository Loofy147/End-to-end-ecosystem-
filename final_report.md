# Final Report: Knowledge-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Agent

## 1. Introduction

This report details the development of a sophisticated reinforcement learning agent designed to solve a mathematical puzzle. The agent's key innovation lies in its ability to incorporate external knowledge from both text and images, allowing it to learn more efficiently and generalize better to new, unseen problems.

## 2. Agent Architecture

The agent's architecture is composed of several key components:

- **`GoalDecompositionAgent`**: This is the core of our AI. It uses a hierarchical approach to problem-solving, breaking down large, complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-goals.

- **`HierarchicalQNetwork`**: A neural network with separate heads for meta-actions (high-level strategy) and low-level actions. This allows the agent to learn both what to do and how to do it.

- **`PathLearningAgent`**: This component learns from the agent's past successes and failures, providing guidance to avoid repeating mistakes.

- **`KnowledgeBase`**: A repository of external knowledge, sourced from both text and images. This knowledge base provides the agent with general principles and strategies that can be applied to a wide range of problems.

## 3. Knowledge Integration

A key feature of this project is the integration of external knowledge. We have successfully implemented two mechanisms for this:

- **Text-Based Knowledge**: Using a pre-trained sentence-similarity model (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), the agent can understand and utilize textual information. This allows us to provide the agent with general advice and heuristics, such as "take big steps when far from the target."

- **Image-Based Knowledge**: By leveraging an image-to-text model (`nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning`), the agent can extract insights from visual data. This enables it to learn from diagrams, examples of solved puzzles, and other visual aids.

## 4. Training and Evaluation

The agent was trained in a `KnowledgeEnhancedEnv`, a custom environment that provides context-specific knowledge during training. This approach has proven to be highly effective, as the agent learns to associate specific situations with relevant pieces of knowledge.

Our evaluation on a range of new, unseen puzzles has shown that the knowledge-enhanced agent outperforms its predecessors. It is more adaptable, less prone to getting stuck in loops, and more efficient in finding solutions.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work

This project has demonstrated the significant potential of integrating external knowledge into reinforcement learning agents. By combining the agent's own experience with general principles from text and images, we have created a more robust and intelligent system.

Future work could explore more advanced knowledge integration techniques, such as:

- **Automated Knowledge Discovery**: Developing methods for the agent to automatically discover new knowledge from its interactions with the environment.
- **Multi-Modal Learning**: Creating a single, unified model that can process text, images, and other data modalities simultaneously.
- **Real-World Applications**: Applying this technology to more complex, real-world problems, such as robotics, game playing, and logistics.
